# Data Pipeline Project

## Overview
- This is my first assignment in EEET2574 - Big Data for Engineering (RMIT University)
- This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Docker containers for Kafka and Cassandra, along with producers and consumers, to create a data pipeline. The data pipeline will fetch weather information from OpenWeatherMap and store it in Cassandra, with the option for data visualization.
- The origin structure: https://github.com/salcaino/sfucmpt733

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x:** The project is primarily written in Python to take advantage of its versatility and extensive ecosystem of libraries.

- **Apache Kafka:** Kafka is used as a distributed event streaming platform to facilitate the real-time ingestion of data from multiple sources.

- **Apache Cassandra:** Cassandra serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving the processed data efficiently.

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Jupyter Notebooks are employed for data visualization and exploratory data analysis. They provide an interactive and user-friendly environment for data scientists and analysts.

- **Docker:** The project is containerized using Docker, enabling seamless deployment across different environments and simplifying dependencies management.

- **Visual Studio Code (VSCode):** VSCode is the integrated development environment (IDE) of choice for coding. It offers robust support for Python development and Docker integration.

- **Windows Terminal:** Windows Terminal provides a unified command-line interface for executing commands and managing the project.

## APIs
The project integrates with the following APIs:

- OpenWeather API: Used for retrieving weather data for inclusion in the data pipeline. Link: https://openweathermap.org/api

## Prerequisites

Before using the data pipeline, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Python 3.x installed
- Docker installed for containerization

## Getting Started

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DeathHunterX/Simple-datapipeline.git

cd Simple-datapipeline
# or
cd */Simple-datapipeline
```
### Configuration
Add or edit the configuration settings in owm-producer and iqair-producer folders to match your environment and data sources. (If you do that already, please ignore it)

```bash
# Use terminal to apply below command

# For own-producer (OpenWeather API)
echo [openweathermap_api_credential] > owm-producer/openweathermap_service.cfg
echo access_token=your_api_key >> owm-producer/openweathermap_service.cfg

# For iqair-producer (IQAir API)
echo [iqairmap_api_credential] > iqair-producer/iqairmap_service.cfg
echo access_token=your_api_key >> iqair-producer/iqairmap_service.cfg
```

## Usage
### Running the Pipeline

1. Create network for Kafka and Cassandra
```bash
docker network create kafka-network
docker network create cassandra-network
docker network ls   # Check if successfully created
```

2. Set up Kafka and Cassandra containers 
```bash
# Run Kafka and Cassandra 
docker-compose -f cassandra/docker-compose.yml up -d
docker-compose -f kafka/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Check all running containers if Kafka and Cassandra are running
docker ps -a    
```

3. Access Kafka UI frontend

- Open http://localhost:9000 (username: admin; password: bigbang)

- Add a data pipeline cluster:
    + Cluster Name: mycluster
    + Cluster Zookeeper: zookeeper:2181

- Enable the following options:
    + Enable JMX Polling
    + Poll consumer information
    + Enable Active OffsetCache Click Save.  

4. Open WSL or Ubuntu and execute this command. It will 
. If the output is `["twittersink","weathersink","fakersink", "iqairsink"]`, skip Step 5. Otherwise, go to next step

```bash
# Check if all sink from Kafka is created. If not, go to Step 5 and check it again, else skip next step
curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

5. Access to kafka-connect shell and run this command (this is a bug so you need to run it indirect)
```bash
./start-and-wait.sh
```

6. Initialize Provider and Consumer for Kafka with 3 different APIs
```bash
# Provider
# Open Weather API
docker-compose -f owm-producer/docker-compose.yml up -d
# Faker API
docker-compose -f faker-producer/docker-compose.yml up -d
# IQAir API
docker-compose -f iqair-producer/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Consumer
docker-compose -f consumers/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

7. Open Cassandra via Docker and check if all the data has been flowed to the database
```bash
# run it to access Cassandra
docker exec -it cassandra bash

# Access Cassandra Shell
cqlsh

# Check all keyspaces
desc keyspaces;

use kafkapipeline;

# Check all tables in a keyspace
desc tables;

# Check data
select * from weatherreport;
select * from fakerdata;
select * from iqairdata;

# Exit Cassandra Shell
exit

# Exit Docker Container
exit
```

8. Set up Data Visualization
```bash
docker-compose -f data-vis/docker-compose.yml up -d
```
Open http://localhost:8888 for data visualization.

Now, you have successfully set up the Docker containers for Kafka and Cassandra, created a data pipeline, and visualized the data.

Note:
- Cassandra will lose data if you don't use for at least 12 hours
- Kafka broker has bug which when you try to rerun Kafka, it will get crashed or if you try to rerun it again, it will work but not for functionality. So one way to fix it is delete Kafka container and rebuild it again.
